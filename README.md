_An insteristing mathematic game_

_with simple H5 UI & alogrithm for calculation._

- best: 30 * 30 solved

- average: 25 * 25 solved in 1s

and I'm bending myself to optimizing it as possible...

***calc_v1: ordinary calculation***

***calc_v2: use list to optimize, but effects are not obvious...***

I’m such a joker…
