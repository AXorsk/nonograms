the version with points somewhere maybe cannot be predicted!

- 50 * 50          solved in 90s
- 30 * 30          solved in 5s
- 25 * 25 (& less) solved in 10ms

and I'm bending myself to optimizing it as possible...

**calc_v1: ordinary version**

**calc_v2: list-optimized version (no positive effects...)**

**calc_v3: better-analyzing version**
