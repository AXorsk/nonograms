_An insteristing mathematic game_

_with simple H5 UI & alogrithm for calculation._

- "code_(score)" for 10 * 10

- "code__(score)" for 20 * 20


==best: 30 * 30 solved==

==average: 25 * 25 solved in 1s==

and I'm bending myself to optimizing it as possible...

***calc_v1: ordinary calculation***

***calc_v2: use list to optimize, but effects are not obvious...***

I’m such a joker…
