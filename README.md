# nonograms
_An insteristing mathematic game_

_with simple H5 UI & alogrithm for calculation._

<u>(with somewhere cannot be predicted !!)</u>

- 50*50 solved in 90s
- 30 * 30 solved in 5s
- 25 * 25 (& less) solved in 10ms

and I'm bending myself to optimizing it as possible...

**calc_v1: ordinary version**

**calc_v2: list-optimized version (no positive effects...)**

**calc_v3: better-analyzing version**
